This is a simple Turtle Dodge Game where there are two types of objects(enemies), red and purple.
There are two levels in the program. There is a MovingObject Class that is the root and everything else in beneath it.

There is a Invinsible powerup( the  blue triangle) that follows you throughout the game.
When you turn Invinsible, your turtle changes from the color black to the color gold.
When you are out of the powerup for a certain amount of time, your turtle goes back to the color black.
